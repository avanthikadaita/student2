# Week 3 Lab Notebook

---

## Project 1
JsInput

- After finding the code to this project, I added another file under _posts to save this
- Then, this showed up under "Hack" in my lab notebook and I was able to access it 
- I tried something out like change the number around to see how the grades would differ

### Troubles
Some troubles I faced, expecially in JsInput, was that it was a very vague project to work on as I didn't know the exact requirments to calculate my grade. However, I did undestand the gist of it and was able to get it up and running.

## Project 2
JsOutput

- From the table already given, I edited the heading so it is more suitbale to my interests. I added a list of instruments that I like and a few of which I've playes/learned 
- I really enjoyed this as it allowed me to express this I love and am passionate about through putting it on the lab notebook 
- I tried out a couple themes to see how the table would change and I liked midnight the best because it showed a clear chart without any bugs

### Troubles
I had trouble with adding images for each type nof instrument because the size was difficult to adjust so it fits the page.
