## Data Types, Lists, Dictionaries
- Python uses variables to store data, which have names, types, and data

- Variable types in Python include String, Integer, Float, List, and Dictionary

- Lists are used to collect many instances of a pattern, while Dictionaries organize data patterns

- Iteration is often used to process through lists

- An example constructs a List of people and cars using dictionaries

- Data in Lists and Dictionaries is useful for exchanging data between programs and programmers

- Functions like print_data and for_loop are defined to format and print data from the List

- There are alternate methods for iteration, including a while loop and recursion
