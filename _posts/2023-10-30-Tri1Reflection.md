## Trimester 1 Reflection:

Memories and Learnings:

Instrument Practice Tracker: During trimester 1, I developed an "Instruments Practice Tracker" web application. This tracker allows users to input their daily practice time for a musical instrument and visualizes their progress in a bar chart. It was a great learning experience in web development and data visualization using Chart.js.

HTML and CSS Skills: I improved my HTML and CSS skills while creating the practice tracker user interface. I learned how to structure a web page, style it, and make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript Programming: I gained a better understanding of JavaScript programming by incorporating interactivity into the practice tracker. The code allows users to submit their practice time and updates the chart in real-time.

HTTP Requests: I learned how to make HTTP POST requests to a server to store user practice data. This involved using the fetch API to send data to a backend server.

Data Visualization: Through using Chart.js, I learned how to create dynamic and engaging data visualizations, such as the practice time bar chart, to represent user progress effectively.

Positive Accomplishments:

Functional Practice Tracker: I successfully developed a functional practice tracker that fulfills its purpose of helping musicians monitor their practice time and progress.

Improved Coding Skills: My coding skills, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, have significantly improved, enabling me to create interactive web applications.

Data Visualization: I gained a new skill in data visualization, allowing me to present data in a more understandable and engaging way.

Things to Learn in Future Trimesters:

Backend Development: In future trimesters, I intend to dive deeper into backend development, including creating APIs and databases to store and retrieve user data securely.

User Authentication: Implementing user authentication and account management features to enhance the practice tracker's usability and security.

Mobile Responsiveness: I want to make the practice tracker mobile-responsive to ensure users can access and use it on various devices.

Opportunities for Growth:

User Feedback: Receiving feedback from users to understand their needs and preferences better and refining the practice tracker accordingly.

Collaboration: Collaborating with others on web development projects to enhance teamwork and learn from different perspectives.

Project Scaling: Exploring opportunities to scale the practice tracker or other web applications, possibly involving cloud services and more complex features.

In conclusion, trimester 1 was a valuable learning experience, and I look forward to applying the knowledge gained in future trimesters to create even more sophisticated and user-friendly web applications.
