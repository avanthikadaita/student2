### Creating Personal Blog


Followed the instructions on https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template. On the main page of the repository, I clicked on "Use this template" and then an option labeled "create a new repository" and created a new repository called avanthikadaita/Daita_a.

I cloned a local copy of the forked repository by calling git clone https://github.com/avanthikadaita/Daita_a.git. This provided a local copy of the entire codebase in my machine at "~/vscode/code"

I was then able to open the entire project in vscode

followed instructions for MacOS Setup found at: https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher//5.a/c4.1/2023/08/16/github_pages_setup_IPYNB_2_.html.

opened the Terminal in vscode though View->Terminal

At the prompt, I issued -> bundle install

I then invoked make

I launched the local web server using the command: bundle exec jekyll serve

The server was launched at: http://127.0.0.1:4000/student/

I opened this link in the browser (http://127.0.0.1:4000/student/)

This showed the HTML File associated with the default index.md

I modified _config.yml by choosing a theme

Then modified index.md to make it my own home page including my interests and classes

Then I saved this information in vscode and reloaded http://127.0.0.1:4000/student/ which gave me a finished blog

Then I committed and then pushed these files forked repository
