## Project 1

- Calculator was obtained from Teacher in the _post directory
- Calculator also requires assets directory also obtained from Teacher
- We were able to customize to how we liked it using assets/css 
- assets/js contains vanta animations 
- Code cell requires `%%html` at the top of cell to support css, html, script.

## Project 2
Python Quiz
- The original copy was found in from teacher
- Then quiz was brought to my directory and put under _posts
- Then it was edited to change the questions that seemed more suitable to me
- I then placed the answers set "==" to rsp
- This was then saved and reloaded to appear under hacks from week 1

### Troubles
I edited the main script of the python quiz given in the "2023-08-30-PythonQuiz.ipynb" instead of im "2023-08-30-PythongQuiz_IPNYB_2_.md". This was a struggle because it wouldn't show my quiz on the lab notebook.
