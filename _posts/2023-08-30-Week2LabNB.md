# Week 2 Lab Notebook

---

## Project 1
Classic Snake Game

- Through the message in Slack, I was able to the access the code for the Classic Snake Game in the link "sources"
- Then created "2023-08-30-Classic Snake Game.md" file under my directory in _posts
- I saved this and created another md file to add the game link onto my Lab Notebook
- Whem reloaded, the game was successfuly copied 

### Troubles
Some troubles I faced were that I forot to add the date in the md file and this caused a lot of issues as the game wouldn't appear properly on the notebook. Soon, I figured tht adding the date was the solution to fix this.

## Project 2
Game of Life

- I imported this code form the Teacher to my directory
- This game's source was also provided in the Slack message
- This was interesting to add to my notebook because I had never played this game so it was difficult to undersant if there was something wrong with the code or if I could edit it to make it more efficient.
