    "Tic-Tac-Toe Game\n",
    "Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where the goal is to get three of your marks (either \"X\" or \"O\") in a row, column, or diagonal on a 3x3 grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Game Board\n",
    "The game board is a 3x3 grid represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Players take turns to place their marks on the board by specifying the position where they want to place their mark (e.g., \"1\" for the top-left corner).\n",
    "\n",
    "Game Flow\n",
    "The game starts with an empty board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Player \"X\" goes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Players take turns to make their moves by specifying a position on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game continues until one player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or the board is full (a tie).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a player wins, the game ends, and that player is declared the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the board is full and there is no winner, the game ends in a tie.\n",
